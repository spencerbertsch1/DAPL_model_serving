# this dashboard reads the entire data set and re-trains models every time an inference happens. This is usually 
# very bad practice, but it's ok because there are only 800 samples and 4 features. The keen reader could fix this 
# problem by loading the trained model from disk instead of re-training it every time - that would only require a few lines of code.
